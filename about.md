I am currenly doing MS in Computer Science at [Rutgers Univesity](rutgers.edu). I am also working as a Data Scientist with Dr. Xiang Liu in the Transportation Enginering Department. For the last few months I have been involved in a risk analysis project, where we developed models for rail defect predictions.
