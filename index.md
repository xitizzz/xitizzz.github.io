I am currently working as a Data Scientist at [Black Knight Inc](https://www.blackknightinc.com/). I have completed MS in Computer Science from [Rutgers Univesity](https://www.rutgers.edu). While in school, I worked as a Research Data Scientist with [Dr. Xiang Liu](https://cee.rutgers.edu/fac/xiang-liu) at the Center for Advanced Infrastructure and Transportation. I am also conducting independent research on deep learning and natural language processing with [Prof. Gerard De Melo](gerard.demelo.org)

I am interested in anything and everything that includes huge amount of data and/or complex coding (best if both). I am particularly interested if machine learning part of data science, as it is often the most exciting part and also the most challenging.
