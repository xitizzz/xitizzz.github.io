I am currenly doing MS in Computer Science at [Rutgers Univesity](rutgers.edu). I am also working as a Data Scientist with Dr. Xiang Liu in the Transportation Enginering Department. I am interested in anything and everything that includes huge amount of data and/or coding (best if both). I am perticularly interested if machine learning part of data science, as it is often the most exciting part and also the most chellanging.
